Our recycling process is stamped and certified by an environmental engineer, PE, and after the toys are dismantled the waste streams of hard plastic, soft plastic, electronics, metals, and silicone, are delivered to the proper facilities for recycling.

Consumers receive a $10 credit on a future purchase, and keep unwanted adult toys out of the land fill. We also have a separate recycling program for adult toy manufacturers and wholesalers.

Items can be shipped to Scarlet Girl (there is no drop-off). Full details can be found on the website.","","false","false","false","false"
