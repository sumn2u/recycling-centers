The remaining funds support the Wireless Foundation. Sprint Project Connect accepts all makes and models of phones at Sprint Stores nationwide.
Your donation will help raise funds to support K-12 education.
It's good for the environment - obsolete models will be recycled in an environmentally friendly manner.
You'll be getting rid of unwanted clutter and benefiting a good cause at the same time 
Your donation may be tax deductible. 
Since its inception, Sprint Project Connect has raised nearly $1 million for charitable programs.","","false","false","false","false"
