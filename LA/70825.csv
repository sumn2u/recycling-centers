Through Sprint Project Connect, donated wireless phones are either recycled or resold. The majority of the net proceeds from resale benefit K-12 education programs through the Sprint Foundation. The remaining funds support the Wireless Foundation. Sprint Project Connect accepts all makes and models of phones at Sprint Stores nationwide.
Your donation will help raise funds to support K-12 education.
It's good for the environment - obsolete models will be recycled in an environmentally friendly manner.
You'll be getting rid of unwanted clutter and benefiting a good cause at the same time 
Your donation may be tax deductible. 
Since its inception, Sprint Project Connect has raised nearly $1 million for charitable programs.","","false","false","false","false"
