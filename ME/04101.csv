The center was founded by a group of educators who wanted to encourage the creative use of materials that were being habitually discarded by the Maine industry. 

The center has served as a model to help start centers in other states such as New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. 

The first home for this "clearing house" was at Pond Cove School in Cape Elizabeth. Then, we moved to Fort Williams. After several other address changes, we finally settled at our present location on Forest Avenue in Portland. 

For 26 years, the Creative Resource Center collects, sorts, and re-uses clean, safe scrap materials from the Maine industries. These materials are offered to the general public for creative and educational uses at a nominal cost. At least 50 tons of discarded materials are re-used annually.  Please call for a complete list of material accepted.","","false","false","false","false"
