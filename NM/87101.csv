The ReStore may not accept certain donations at a given time due to an oversupply in the store.  Please call to schedule pick-up service. Habitat for Humanity provides families an opportunity to buy building materials that they may not otherwise be able to afford. This will help raise the standards of housing. By recycling goods that would have been sent to a landfill, the ReStore also helps reduce waste disposal costs.","","false","false","false","false"
