A complete recycling service is what we offer, from corporate to employee recycling programs and collection events, to simple single office pick ups. We have helped create custom programs for cities and small businesses and special interest groups.

Drop offs can be made Monday to Friday. No appointment necessary, just check in with the receptionist on arrival. If you have a large load please call first so we can reserve dock space. We charge $5.00 for computer monitors and $10.00 for televisions.

Pick up fees may be assessed, depending on the types of items, and equipment restrictions. Providing safe insured professionals for the removal of your equipment is not something we offer for free lightly.","","false","false","false","false"
