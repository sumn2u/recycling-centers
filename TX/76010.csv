Habitat also provides families an opportunity to buy building materials that they may not otherwise be able to afford. This will help raise the standards of housing. By recycling goods that would have been sent to a landfill, the ReStore also helps reduce waste disposal costs. If you have materials to donate, please call for more information. The Habitat ReStore takes most materials and the staff will be glad to talk with you.","","false","false","false","false"
