With the help of Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, a major tobacco manufacturer in the US, the waste collected through the Cigarette Waste Brigade will be recycled into a variety of industrial products, such as plastic pallets, and any remaining tobacco will be re-worked into tobacco composting.

If you or your participants do not smoke, or are under the age of 21, please visit our other Brigade programs to see how you can help the environment.
