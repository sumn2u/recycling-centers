We'll sell the gadgets online to fund our literacy efforts and people will receive a great (and easy) tax deduction. Some of the phones will be given to organizations we work with which support abused women (or otherwise disadvantaged women or families). 
We have a pre-paid address label that can downloaded from our website. If need be, we can mail a postage-paid bubble envelope for cell phones, iPods, e-readers and iPads.","","false","false","false","false"
